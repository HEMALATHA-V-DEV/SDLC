# SDLC

```
The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is the cost-effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and build high-quality software.
```

# benefits of SDLC:

```
Increased visibility of the development process for all stakeholders involved
Efficient estimation, planning, and scheduling
Improved risk management and cost estimation
```

# Stages of the SDLC:

Plan → Design → Develop → Test → Deploy → Maintain

```
Phase 1: Planning & Requirements Analysis
Objective: Understand the project goals and determine if the project is feasible.
Activities:
Gather requirements from stakeholders (users, customers, etc.).
Conduct feasibility studies (technical, financial, and operational).
Create a project plan with timelines and resources.
Outcome: A clear understanding of project goals and requirements, documented in a Software Requirements Specification (SRS).

Phase 2: Defining Requirements
Objective: Define and document all the functional and non-functional requirements of the system.
Functional requirements describe what the system should do (e.g., features and functionalities)
Non-functional requirements describe how the system should perform (e.g., performance, security, usability).

Activities:
Analyze the detailed requirements.
Prioritize the features and functionalities.
Identify user interactions and system behavior.
Outcome: Detailed Requirement Specification documents (such as SRS or FRD - Functional Requirements Document).

Phase 3: Design
Objective: Create the architecture and design for the system based on requirements.
Activities:
High-level design (overall system architecture).
Low-level design (detailed design of modules, data flow, etc.).
Choose technology, tools, and frameworks.
Outcome: Design documents (High-Level Design and Low-Level Design), including UI/UX designs and database structures.

Phase 4: Coding (Development)
Objective: Convert design into code to build the actual software.
Activities:
Write code for all components (frontend, backend, database).
Integrate modules and perform internal testing.
Code review and optimization.
Outcome: A functional software system or application.

Phase 5: Testing
Objective: Ensure the software works as expected and is free from defects.
Activities:
Perform various types of testing (unit, integration, system, user acceptance).
Identify and fix bugs.
Validate that the system meets requirements.
Outcome: A stable, bug-free software ready for deployment.

Phase 6: Deployment
Objective: Make the software available for use in a production environment.
Activities:
Deploy the software on servers or distribute it to users.
Configure necessary environments (e.g., servers, databases).
Train users (if needed) and perform final checks.
Outcome: Software is live and accessible to users.

Phase 7: Maintenance
Objective: Ensure the software continues to operate smoothly after deployment.
Activities:
Monitor the software for performance issues or bugs.
Provide updates, patches, and new features as required.
Address user feedback and support.
Outcome: A well-maintained and updated system that meets ongoing user needs.

Prototype is an early version of the software used to demonstrate and validate design concepts, gather user feedback, and refine requirements. 

Sprint is a short, fixed period (usually 1-4 weeks) in Agile development where a team works on specific tasks to create a small, usable part of the project. At the end of the Sprint, the team delivers a working product or feature. It’s a way to break large projects into manageable pieces and deliver progress frequently.

Specific roles designed to ensure the project runs smoothly:

Scrum Master
The Scrum Master is like a coach for the Scrum team. They help the team work better together and solve problems that slow them down. They also make sure everyone follows the Scrum rules.
Scrum Team
The Scrum Team is a group of people who work together to build a product. This team can include developers, designers, and testers. They plan their work and aim to finish tasks during short work periods called Sprints.


# Key differences between DevOps and Traditional SDLC:

```
Team Collaboration:

DevOps: Development and operations teams work together.
Traditional SDLC: Teams work separately, often with little communication.
Speed of Releases:

DevOps: Faster, frequent releases using automation.
Traditional SDLC: Slower, fewer releases as steps are done manually and in stages.
Automation:

DevOps: Heavy use of automation for testing, deployment, and monitoring.
Traditional SDLC: More manual work, less automation.
Responsibility:

DevOps: Developers also manage operations tasks, like monitoring the app.
Traditional SDLC: Developers write the code, but separate teams handle deployment and operations.
Feedback:

DevOps: Continuous feedback from real-time monitoring to fix issues faster.
Traditional SDLC: Feedback comes later, often after the whole project is done.
